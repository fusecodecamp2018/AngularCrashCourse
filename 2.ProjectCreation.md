## Run through of how to install software needed and creating a new project

Install NodeJS
https://nodejs.org/en/

Install Angular's CLI (using NodeJS)
```
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

Create a new angular project
```
cd <YourProjectDirectoryLocation>
ng new my-app --style=scss
```

(Optional) Create Git repository for the project
```
cd my-app
git init
git add -A
git commit -m "Initial commit of the application"
```

Notes:
- NodeJS isn't just needed to install Angular's CLI, it is also inherently used in Angular projects for importing libraries and local hosting the app for development testing.
